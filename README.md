## Getting started ##

### OSX ###
Make sure the following packages/applications are installed:
- [Homebrew]:(http://brew.sh/)
- [CMake]:(http://www.cmake.org/)
- Xcode (>= 6.4) or GCC (>= 4.9)

Then install libUSB (>=1.0.20), HIDAPI (>= 0.8.0) and RtMIDI (>=2.1.0) if needed:
```
brew install hidapi libusb rtmidi
```
If you want to build the python wrapper, you'll need to install Boost.python:
```
brew install boost --with-python
brew install boost-python
```
And if you want to build the documentation, you'll need to install Doxygen:
```
brew install doxygen
```
Clone this repository locally and create a **build** subfolder:
```
git clone https://github.com/shaduzlabs/cabl.git
cd cabl && mkdir build && cd build
```
Now launch CMake, build and (eventually) install:
```
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
Please have a look at the CMake appendix for more CMake options.

### Linux ###
Make sure the following packages/applications are installed:
- [CMake]:(http://www.cmake.org/)
- Clang (>= 3.7) or GCC (>= 4.9)

Then install libUSB (>=1.0.20), HIDAPI (>= 0.8.0) and RtMIDI (>=2.1.0) if needed (depending on your linux distribution and dependency manager, the command below might look slightly different):
```
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libhidapi-dev librtmidi-dev
```
If you want to build the python wrapper, you'll need to install Boost.python:
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev
```
And if you want to build the documentation, you'll need to install Doxygen:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
Clone this repository locally and create a **build** subfolder:
```
git clone https://github.com/shaduzlabs/cabl.git
cd cabl && mkdir build && cd build
```
Now launch CMake, build and (eventually) install:
```
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
Please have a look at the CMake appendix for more CMake options.

### Windows ###
Make sure the following packages/applications are installed:
- [CMake]:(http://www.cmake.org/)
- Visual Studio 2015 or above

If you want to build the documentation, you'll need to install Doxygen.

Clone this repository locally and create a **build** subfolder:
```
git clone https://github.com/shaduzlabs/cabl.git
cd cabl
mkdir build
cd build
```
Now launch CMake:
```
cmake ..
```
If all worked fine, you shoould end up with several VS project files and a solution (cabl.sln).

Please have a look at the CMake appendix for more CMake options.

## Appendix ##
### CMake options ###
By default, CMake is configured to build only the static version of the library. You can override this setting using:
- BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=[ON|OFF]
- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[ON|OFF]
For example, if you want to build both the shared and the static library, you'll need to write:
```
cmake -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
```
On Windows LibUSB, HIDAPI and RtMIDI are downloaded from the respective repositories and built locally in the build subfolder, so you don't need to have them installed on the system. If for some reason you want the same behavior on Linux or OS, you can override CABL_FORCE_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES (default is OFF) and set it to ON.
```
cmake -DCABL_FORCE_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES=ON ..
```
